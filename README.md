# ML-Clustering

A model selection for tissue patch clustering.

1. Gaussian mixture model: It uses probability distribution to classify the data into different categories. 

2. Hierarchical clustering: It is an algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters in a tree form. It is an unsupervised learning method. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) is done by measuring the dissimilarities between the data points. It has two types in general:  
a. Agglomerative (Bottom-Up Approach) 
b. Divisive (Top-Down Approach)
